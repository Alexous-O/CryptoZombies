# CryptoZombies

## Project Description 

The goal of this project was to understand programming on the blockchain with smart contracts

This project was a discovery to understand programming in this environment


## Learn

To learn, I followed the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) courses where they explained programming, the environment...

The programming was done in Solidity<sup>1</sup>, JavaScript and Web3.js



There were different parts, with lessons and practice, error correction :

The project is really backend, with the creation of smart contracts, the JavaScript links the interface to the contracts, it was a bit complicated at first, but the site explains it quite well so you can get the hang of it quickly.

<sup>1</sup>Solidity is an object-oriented programming language dedicated to writing smart contracts. It is used to implement smart contracts on various blockchains, including Ethereum.*
